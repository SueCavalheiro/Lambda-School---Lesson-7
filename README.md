# Lambda-School---Lesson-7
JavaScript Lessons from Lambda School

Exercise: HtmlElement Class
In this exercise you will be dealing with an existing class and methods called
HTMLClass, which is a javascript mock out of the HTML language. 
Your job is to use the existing class and methods to create instances
and expand the methods of the class

Study and reference lines 1 - 83. DO NOT ALTER any of the code on these lines. Your assignment starts on line 85.

Question 1: you will need to assign the variables to a new HTMLElement, but you will also need to call some methods for each one. elementA is complete for you, so use that as a template for the rest.  Study the HTMLElement class to understand which methods to call and what arguments to pass them. 

Question 2: You will need to create an element, stepsToWorldDomination, then you will need to create 4 child elements, according to the instructions, and pass each of these elements in order to the `stepsToWorldDomination` element.

Question 3: You will need to create a new method on the prototype (don't worry that part is done for you). Hint: Remember you have access to the `this` keyword and each instance of the class has a `classes` array. 

Question 4 (NOT REQUIRED): That's up to you!
